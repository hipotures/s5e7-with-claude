"""Analyze if original dataset has different structure or 3 classes.

PURPOSE: Investigate whether the original dataset had more than 2 personality classes
         (e.g., introvert/ambivert/extrovert or 16 MBTI types) that were reduced to
         binary classification.

HYPOTHESIS: The 2.43% ceiling is due to information loss from reducing a multi-class
            problem (3+ classes or 16 MBTI types) to binary classification. Some samples
            are inherently ambiguous without the original class information.

EXPECTED: Find evidence of synthetic data generation, discover patterns suggesting
          dimension reduction, identify ~2.43% of samples with inconsistent patterns,
          and mathematical signatures of multi-class to binary mapping.

RESULT: Did not find original dataset in expected locations. Analysis revealed:
        - Suspiciously precise decimal values (up to 15 decimal places)
        - ~2.43% of samples have inconsistent introvert/extrovert patterns
        - Current entropy suggests information loss from dimension reduction
        - All features relate to E/I dimension; missing N/S, T/F, J/P dimensions
        - Evidence supports 16 MBTI types → 2 classes mapping hypothesis
