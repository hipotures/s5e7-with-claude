PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES NULL ANALYSIS
============================================================

Predictions by psychological null presence:
No psych nulls: 5162 records, 21.5% predicted as Introvert
Has psych nulls: 1013 records, 44.4% predicted as Introvert

Detailed null analysis:

Drained_after_socializing:
  With null: 432 records, 56.5% predicted as Introvert
  No null: 5743 records, 22.9% predicted as Introvert
  Ratio: 2.46x more likely to be Introvert with null

Stage_fear:
  With null: 598 records, 36.0% predicted as Introvert
  No null: 5577 records, 24.2% predicted as Introvert
  Ratio: 1.49x more likely to be Introvert with null

============================================================
CONSISTENCY CHECK: EXPECTED VS ACTUAL
============================================================

Expected patterns (from training data):
- Drained_after_socializing null: 4.2x more likely to be Introvert
- Stage_fear null: 1.8x more likely to be Introvert
- Overall: Introverts should have 2-4x more nulls

Actual prediction patterns:

High null (2+): 48.5% predicted as Introvert
No nulls: 16.6% predicted as Introvert
Ratio: 2.91x

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================================

âœ“ CONSISTENT: Model predictions align with null patterns!
  - High null records are 2.91x more likely to be predicted as Introvert

Recommendations:
2. Drained_after_socializing null pattern is under-utilized
   - Expected: 4.2x more introverts, Actual: 2.45x
   - Consider special handling for this critical null

3. Potential accuracy improvement:
   - 150 high-null records predicted as Extrovert
   - Potential improvement: up to 2.43%
