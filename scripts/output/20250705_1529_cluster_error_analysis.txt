Problematic Cluster Patterns:
------------------------------------------------------------

Cluster 2.0 (Error rate: 5.6%):
  → Mixed/unusual pattern

Cluster 7.0 (Error rate: 5.6%):
  → High alone time + Low social (Introvert-like but misclassified)

======================================================================
ANALYSIS COMPLETE
======================================================================

Key findings:
1. Error rates vary significantly across clusters (0% to >10%)
2. Highest error rates in ambiguous/boundary clusters
3. Some clusters have NO errors (clear personality types)
4. Test errors follow similar cluster patterns as training errors
