COMPARISON: most_ambiguous_2.43pct.csv vs enhanced_ambiguous_450.csv
====================================================================

1. STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES
-------------------------

ORIGINAL (most_ambiguous_2.43pct.csv):
- Columns: id, Time_spent_Alone, Stage_fear, Social_event_attendance, Going_outside, 
          Drained_after_socializing, Friends_circle_size, Post_frequency, Personality,
          is_extrovert, high_alone_time, low_social_events, many_friends, high_posting,
          gets_drained, has_stage_fear, isfj_pattern, infp_pattern, enfj_pattern,
          typical_introvert_score, typical_extrovert_score, ambiguity_score
- Total columns: 21
- Note: Contains many derived features and pattern indicators

ENHANCED (enhanced_ambiguous_450.csv):
- Columns: id, Time_spent_Alone, Social_event_attendance, Going_outside, 
          Friends_circle_size, Post_frequency, Stage_fear, Drained_after_socializing,
          Personality, ambiguity_score, composite_ambiguity
- Total columns: 11
- Note: Simpler structure with composite_ambiguity as key addition

2. SAMPLE OVERLAP
-----------------
- Both files: 450 samples each
- Common samples: 120 (26.7%)
- Unique to original: 330 (73.3%)
- Unique to enhanced: 330 (73.3%)

3. KEY DIFFERENCES IN APPROACH
------------------------------

ORIGINAL APPROACH:
- Based purely on ambiguity_score (boundary proximity)
- All samples have ambiguity_score = 0.0 or very low
- Includes many engineered features (patterns, flags)
- Contains special values like 3.1377639321564557 (ambivert markers)

ENHANCED APPROACH:
- Uses composite_ambiguity combining multiple sources:
  * Original ambiguity score
  * Null pattern contradictions
  * Cluster membership (error-prone clusters)
  * Extreme boundary cases
  * Mixed behavioral profiles
- Samples have varying ambiguity_scores (not all zero)
- Includes samples with missing values (nulls)
- More diverse representation of ambiguity

4. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES
--------------------

Original sample (ID 107):
- ambiguity_score: 0.0
- Extrovert with balanced intro/extro scores (0.5/0.5)
- No missing values
- Special Time_spent_Alone value: 3.1377639321564557

Enhanced sample (ID 9067):
- ambiguity_score: 0.333
- composite_ambiguity: 3.4 (highest)
- Extrovert with 2 missing values (Stage_fear, Drained_after_socializing)
- From cluster 7 (problematic cluster)

5. PHILOSOPHICAL DIFFERENCE
---------------------------

ORIGINAL: "These 450 samples are exactly on the introvert/extrovert boundary"
- Pure mathematical boundary based on score equality
- Clean, deterministic selection

ENHANCED: "These 450 samples are ambiguous for multiple reasons"
- Behavioral ambiguity (original method)
- Null pattern contradictions (extroverts with nulls)
- Cluster-based risk (error-prone groups)
- Mixed signals (high intro AND extro traits)
- Composite approach capturing different types of uncertainty

6. WHY THEY ACHIEVE SAME CV SCORE
---------------------------------
Both approaches identify edge cases that need special handling:
- Original: Mathematical edge cases (score = 0.5)
- Enhanced: Practical edge cases (multiple ambiguity sources)

During CV, both sets get upweighted similarly, leading to similar local performance.
The difference may only appear on unseen test data where the enhanced approach's
diversity could provide better generalization.
