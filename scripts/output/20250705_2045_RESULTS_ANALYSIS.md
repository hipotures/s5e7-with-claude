# Corrected Datasets Results Analysis

## Current Results (from screenshot)

| Dataset | Best Score | Best Model | Total Trials | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|--------------|-------|
| train_corrected_01.csv | **0.973548** | xgb | 13 | 78 extreme introverts fixed |
| train_corrected_02.csv | **0.973386** | cat | 17 | 81 (78+3) bidirectional |
| train_corrected_03.csv | 0.969391 | cat | 11 | Only 6 negative typicality |
| train_corrected_04.csv | **0.974736** | xgb | 10 | 192 psychological contradictions |
| train_corrected_05.csv | 0.970093 | cat | 17 | 34 eleven-hour extroverts |
| train_corrected_06.csv | **0.974034** | cat | 15 | 192 conservative combined |

## Key Findings

### Best Performers
1. **train_corrected_04.csv** - 0.974736 (psychological contradictions)
2. **train_corrected_06.csv** - 0.974034 (conservative combined)
3. **train_corrected_01.csv** - 0.973548 (extreme introverts)

### Poor Performers
- **train_corrected_03.csv** - 0.969391 (too few corrections?)
- **train_corrected_05.csv** - 0.970093 (eleven-hour extroverts not helpful?)

## Distance to Target (0.975708)
- Best so far: 0.974736 (dataset 04)
- **Gap: 0.000972** (less than 0.1%!)

## Patterns
1. **More corrections â‰  always better** - Dataset 03 with only 6 corrections performs worst
2. **Psychological contradictions work well** - Dataset 04 leading
3. **Conservative combined approach** - Dataset 06 also strong
4. **XGBoost vs CatBoost** - Both can achieve high scores

## Recommendations
1. Dataset 07 (218 comprehensive) still pending - might break the barrier
2. Focus on datasets 04 and 06 patterns for future improvements
3. The gap is so small (0.000972) that with more optimization trials, breaking 0.975708 is very likely

## Note on File Naming
The submission files show "train_co" due to truncation. This has been fixed to show "tc01", "tc02", etc. in future runs.
