## 2. Population Stability Index

| Feature | PSI | Stability |
|---------|-----|----------|
| Time_spent_Alone | 0.0006 | Stable ✓ |
| Social_event_attendance | 0.0003 | Stable ✓ |
| Friends_circle_size | 0.0013 | Stable ✓ |
| Going_outside | 0.0023 | Stable ✓ |
| Post_frequency | 0.0010 | Stable ✓ |

## 3. Missing Value Analysis

Missing value percentages show {'significant' if dist_results['significant'].sum() > 3 else 'minimal'} differences.

Key observation: Missing values in numeric features are strongly correlated with Introvert personality type.

## 4. Adversarial Validation

A Random Forest classifier achieved 68.9% accuracy in distinguishing train from test samples.
This indicates that the datasets are significantly different.

## 5. Recommendations

⚠️ **Warning**: The test set has different characteristics from the training set.

Recommended actions:
1. Use robust validation strategies (e.g., adversarial validation splits)
2. Apply domain adaptation techniques
3. Focus on features that are stable across datasets
4. Consider ensemble methods that are robust to distribution shift
