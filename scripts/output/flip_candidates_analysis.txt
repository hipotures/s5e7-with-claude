ANALYSIS OF 5 FLIP CANDIDATES
=============================

Current status: All 5 are predicted as INTROVERT
Recommendation: Flip some/all to EXTROVERT based on patterns

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
==================

1. ID 18876 - STRONG INTROVERT SIGNAL (DO NOT FLIP)
----------------------------------------------------
- Time_spent_Alone: 10.0 (MAXIMUM - extremely introverted)
- Social_event_attendance: NaN (missing)
- Friends_circle_size: 10.0
- Going_outside: 6.0
- Post_frequency: 7.0
- Drained_after_socializing: No

Analysis: Despite having friends and not getting drained, spending 10 hours alone
is the maximum value and a VERY strong introvert signal. This should remain Introvert.

2. ID 20363 - MIXED SIGNALS (MAYBE FLIP)
-----------------------------------------
- Time_spent_Alone: 3.0 (moderate)
- Social_event_attendance: 2.0 (low)
- Friends_circle_size: 3.0 (very low)
- Going_outside: 4.0 (low-moderate)
- Post_frequency: 5.0 (moderate)
- Drained_after_socializing: No (extrovert signal)

Analysis: Low social metrics but doesn't get drained. Borderline case.

3. ID 20934 - CONTRADICTORY INTROVERT (KEEP AS IS)
---------------------------------------------------
- Time_spent_Alone: 2.0 (low)
- Social_event_attendance: 2.0 (low)
- Friends_circle_size: 5.0 (low-moderate)
- Going_outside: 3.0 (low)
- Post_frequency: 8.0 (high)
- Stage_fear: Yes (introvert signal)
- Drained_after_socializing: Yes (STRONG introvert signal)

Analysis: Gets drained after socializing = strong introvert marker. Despite low
alone time, the draining factor confirms introversion.

4. ID 20950 - INCONSISTENT PATTERN (GOOD FLIP CANDIDATE)
---------------------------------------------------------
- Time_spent_Alone: 2.0 (low - extrovert signal)
- Social_event_attendance: 2.0 (low - introvert signal)
- Friends_circle_size: 5.0 (moderate)
- Going_outside: 5.0 (moderate)
- Post_frequency: 4.0 (low-moderate)
- Drained_after_socializing: No (extrovert signal)

Analysis: Low alone time + doesn't get drained = extrovert signals. Low social
attendance might be circumstantial. Good candidate for flipping.

5. ID 21008 - HIGH ACTIVITY EXTROVERT (STRONG FLIP CANDIDATE)
--------------------------------------------------------------
- Time_spent_Alone: 3.0 (moderate)
- Social_event_attendance: 1.0 (very low)
- Friends_circle_size: 5.0 (moderate)
- Going_outside: 6.0 (high)
- Post_frequency: 10.0 (MAXIMUM - very extroverted)
- Drained_after_socializing: No (extrovert signal)

Analysis: Maximum posting frequency + high outdoor activity + doesn't get drained
= strong extrovert signals. Low social attendance conflicts but posting behavior
suggests extroversion.

FLIP RECOMMENDATIONS:
=====================

DEFINITELY FLIP (2):
- ID 20950: Low alone time + no draining = extrovert pattern
- ID 21008: Maximum posting + high activity + no draining = extrovert

MAYBE FLIP (1):
- ID 20363: Mixed signals, but no draining suggests possible extrovert

DO NOT FLIP (2):
- ID 18876: Maximum alone time (10h) = definitive introvert
- ID 20934: Gets drained after socializing = definitive introvert

SUMMARY:
========
Out of 5 candidates:
- 2 strong flips (20950, 21008)
- 1 possible flip (20363)
- 2 should remain introvert (18876, 20934)

This aligns with the pattern that only 2-3 flips might be needed to improve
from 0.975708 to 0.976518.
