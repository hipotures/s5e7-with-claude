Original vs Enhanced Ambiguous Samples
--------------------------------------

1. ORIGINAL AMBIGUOUS SAMPLES (most_ambiguous_2.43pct.csv)
   - Count: 450 samples
   - Method: Lowest ambiguity scores (boundary proximity)
   - Created by: 20250704_0019_find_exact_mapping_rule.py
   - Used in: Achieved 0.96950 accuracy with XGBoost optimization

2. ENHANCED AMBIGUOUS SAMPLES (enhanced_ambiguous_450.csv)
   - Count: 450 samples
   - Method: Composite ambiguity score combining:
     * Original boundary proximity
     * Null pattern insights (63.4% introverts have nulls)
     * Cluster-based patterns (clusters 2 & 7)
     * Extreme boundary cases (50/50 probability)
     * Mixed behavioral profiles
   - Overlap with original: 28.9% (130/450 samples)

3. EXTENDED AMBIGUOUS SAMPLES (enhanced_ambiguous_600.csv)
   - Count: 600 samples
   - Purpose: Capture more diverse ambiguous patterns
   - Breakdown:
     * From original 450: 130
     * With null ambiguity: 288
     * From problematic clusters: 83
     * Boundary cases: 583
     * Mixed profiles: 152
     * Multiple ambiguity sources: 600

KEY INSIGHTS
------------
1. The original method only captured 1 out of 450 samples when recreated,
   suggesting the ambiguity calculation has nuances or the data has changed.

2. The enhanced method identifies different types of ambiguity:
   - Behavioral ambiguity (original method)
   - Null pattern ambiguity (contradictory null patterns)
   - Cluster-based ambiguity (from error-prone clusters)
   - Probability boundary cases (near 50/50)
   - Mixed profiles (high intro AND extro traits)

3. All 600 enhanced samples have multiple ambiguity sources, making them
   more likely to be true edge cases.

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
1. Test both 450 and 600 sample versions in optimization
2. Use higher weights for samples with multiple ambiguity sources
3. Consider cluster-specific strategies for samples from clusters 2 & 7
4. Pay special attention to null pattern contradictions
