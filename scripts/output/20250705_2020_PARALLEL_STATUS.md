# Parallel Optimization Status

## Current Performance
- **17 trials in 56 seconds** = ~18 trials/minute = ~1080 trials/hour
- **3x faster** than sequential execution
- All 3 models (XGB, GBM, CAT) running simultaneously

## Best Results So Far
- **Best Score**: 0.973440 (CAT)
- **Dataset**: train_corrected_01.csv (78 extreme introverts fixed)
- **Progress**: Getting close to 0.975708 barrier!

## Display Issues Fixed
1. ✓ Resource status panel now shows correctly
2. ✓ Dataset column width increased to show full names
3. ✓ Middle layout rendering fixed

## What's Happening
- **XGB**: Running on GPU0/GPU1 (alternating)
- **GBM**: Running on GPU0/GPU1 (alternating) 
- **CAT**: Running on CPU continuously

## Expected Timeline
With 8 datasets × 1 hour each:
- ~1000 trials per dataset
- ~8000 total trials
- Should find optimal parameters to break 0.975708

## Monitor Commands
```bash
# Watch GPU usage
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi

# Check latest submissions
ls -la scores/ | tail -10

# Monitor log file
tail -f output/optimization_logs/parallel_optimization_*.log
```

## Next Steps
1. Let it run for full 8 hours
2. Monitor for any score > 0.975708
3. Best submissions will be in scores/ directory
