# Removed vs Test Comparison Report

## Key Question: Are the removed "hard cases" more similar to the test set?

### Finding 1: Distribution Analysis
The removed samples show mixed similarity to test:
- Some features (like Time_spent_Alone) are closer in removed samples
- Others (like Friends_circle_size) are closer in kept samples

### Finding 2: Missing Value Patterns
Removed samples have missing patterns that may be between kept and test

### Finding 3: Adversarial Validation
Lower scores indicate higher similarity to test set

### Finding 4: Distance Analysis
Euclidean distance in feature space shows which group is closer to test centroid

## Conclusion
The analysis will reveal whether removing "hard cases" accidentally removed 
samples that were more representative of the test distribution.
