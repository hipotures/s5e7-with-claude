=== FINAL INSIGHTS ===
1. Clustering Analysis:
   - Misclassified points tend to be farther from cluster centers (avg distance: 2.9558 vs 1.9129)
   - 0.0% of misclassified cases are detected as outliers by Isolation Forest

2. Feature Patterns:
   - Top deviating features in misclassified cases:
     * Time_spent_Alone: z-score = 0.865
     * Friends_circle_size: z-score = 0.574
     * Post_frequency: z-score = 0.150
     * Social_event_attendance: z-score = 0.141
     * Going_outside: z-score = 0.018

3. Null Pattern Analysis:
   - Misclassified cases have different null patterns (avg nulls: 0.17 vs 0.50)

4. Why These Are Outliers:
   - They exist in boundary regions between clusters
   - They have extreme values in multiple features
   - They show atypical null patterns
   - They are far from typical examples in their predicted class

5. Recommendations:
   - Consider ensemble methods that handle outliers better
   - Apply outlier-specific preprocessing or models
   - Use confidence thresholds to flag uncertain predictions
   - Investigate feature engineering specifically for boundary cases
