# Corrected Training Datasets Report
**Date**: 2025-07-05 17:30  
**Purpose**: Document the creation of corrected training datasets to address suspected labeling errors

## Executive Summary

Analysis revealed that approximately 1.18% (218 cases) of the training data contain suspected labeling errors. These errors likely create an artificial accuracy ceiling around 97.5-98%. Eight corrected datasets were created with different correction strategies, ranging from ultra-conservative (3 corrections) to comprehensive (218 corrections).

## Rationale for Corrections

### The Problem
1. **Accuracy Ceiling**: Models consistently hit ~97.5708% accuracy, suggesting systematic errors
2. **Extreme Contradictions**: Cases with features that strongly contradict their labels
3. **Out-of-Range Values**: 11-hour alone time (beyond expected 0-10 range)
4. **Mathematical Impossibilities**: Negative typicality scores for assigned personality types

### Evidence of Labeling Errors
- **ID 1041**: Labeled "Extrovert" with 11h alone, 0 social events, 0 friends, gets drained, has stage fear
- **ID 1873**: Labeled "Introvert" with 1h alone, 9 social events, 15 friends, posts frequently
- 34 cases with 11h alone time labeled as "Extrovert" (highly improbable)

## Corrected Datasets Overview

### train_corrected_01.csv
- **Corrections**: 78
- **Strategy**: Fix extreme introverts mislabeled as extroverts
- **Criteria**: Time_alone ≥ 8h, Social ≤ 2, Friends ≤ 5, labeled as Extrovert
- **Rationale**: These are clear introvert patterns wrongly labeled

### train_corrected_02.csv
- **Corrections**: 81 (78 + 3)
- **Strategy**: Fix both extreme introverts AND extreme extroverts
- **Criteria**: Added 3 cases with Time_alone ≤ 2h, Social ≥ 8, Friends = 15, no draining
- **Rationale**: Bidirectional correction for balance

### train_corrected_03.csv
- **Corrections**: 6
- **Strategy**: Fix only the most egregious cases
- **Criteria**: Negative typicality scores (mathematically impossible)
- **Rationale**: Ultra-conservative, only fix obvious impossibilities
- **Key IDs**: 1041, 13225, 18437 (all with typicality < -2)

### train_corrected_04.csv
- **Corrections**: 192
- **Strategy**: Fix strong psychological contradictions
- **Criteria**: 
  - Introverts with no introvert traits (no draining, no stage fear, low alone time, high social)
  - Extroverts with all introvert traits (draining, stage fear, high alone time, low social)
- **Rationale**: Psychological profile completely contradicts label

### train_corrected_05.csv
- **Corrections**: 34
- **Strategy**: Fix all 11-hour extroverts
- **Criteria**: Time_alone = 11 (out of range) + labeled Extrovert
- **Rationale**: 11 hours alone is extreme introversion, labeling as extrovert is likely error

### train_corrected_06.csv
- **Corrections**: 192
- **Strategy**: Conservative combined approach
- **Criteria**: Negative typicality OR strong psychological contradictions
- **Rationale**: Balance between being conservative and fixing clear errors

### train_corrected_07.csv
- **Corrections**: 218
- **Strategy**: Comprehensive - fix all identified issues
- **Criteria**: Union of all previous criteria
- **Rationale**: Maximum correction for testing upper bound of improvement

### train_corrected_08.csv
- **Corrections**: 3
- **Strategy**: Ultra-conservative - only the worst cases
- **Criteria**: Only IDs 1041, 13225, 18437
- **Rationale**: Absolute minimum intervention, these 3 are undeniable errors

## Correction Statistics

| Dataset | Corrections | % of Training Data | Strategy |
|---------|------------|-------------------|----------|
| 01 | 78 | 0.42% | Extreme introverts only |
| 02 | 81 | 0.44% | Extreme both directions |
| 03 | 6 | 0.03% | Negative typicality only |
| 04 | 192 | 1.04% | Psychological contradictions |
| 05 | 34 | 0.18% | 11-hour anomalies |
| 06 | 192 | 1.04% | Conservative combined |
| 07 | 218 | 1.18% | Comprehensive |
| 08 | 3 | 0.02% | Ultra-conservative |

## Expected Impact

1. **Conservative Corrections (3-6 cases)**: 
   - Minimal risk, fixes only impossible cases
   - Expected improvement: 0.02-0.03%

2. **Moderate Corrections (34-81 cases)**:
   - Fixes clear categorical errors
   - Expected improvement: 0.2-0.4%

3. **Aggressive Corrections (192-218 cases)**:
   - Addresses all suspicious patterns
   - Expected improvement: 0.5-1.0%
   - Risk: May introduce new errors if some edge cases are legitimate

## Validation Strategy

1. Train models on each corrected dataset
2. Compare CV scores to baseline
3. Generate submissions for each
4. Monitor which correction level performs best on leaderboard

## Key Insights

1. **Most errors are Extrovert mislabeling**: 78 introverts labeled as extroverts vs only 3 extroverts labeled as introverts
2. **11-hour anomaly is significant**: 34 cases with impossible values
3. **Psychological features matter**: Drained_after_socializing and Stage_fear are strong indicators
4. **Error rate aligns with accuracy ceiling**: 1.18% errors ≈ 98.82% max accuracy

## Recommendations

1. Start testing with **train_corrected_08.csv** (ultra-conservative)
2. If improvement seen, progressively test more aggressive corrections
3. **train_corrected_02.csv** (81 corrections) is recommended as balanced approach
4. Use **train_corrected_07.csv** to test maximum potential improvement

## Files Created

All corrected datasets are saved in: `/scripts/output/`
- train_corrected_01.csv through train_corrected_08.csv
- training_corrections_detailed.csv (full analysis of all corrections)

## Next Steps

1. Modify optimization script to use corrected datasets
2. Run full optimization on each corrected dataset
3. Generate submissions for each
4. Compare results to identify optimal correction level
