# Advanced Imputation Methods - Progress Update

## Date: 2025-07-05 10:00
## Status: Running advanced imputation tests

## What We're Testing

### Key Discovery from Previous Analysis
- **Missing values are NOT random** - they encode personality information
- Introverts have significantly higher missing rates, especially for:
  - `Drained_after_socializing`: 14.2% (Intro) vs 3.4% (Extro)
  - `Stage_fear`: 15.4% (Intro) vs 8.4% (Extro)

### Methods Being Tested

1. **MissForest-style Random Forest Imputation**
   - Standard version
   - Personality-aware version (uses target during training)

2. **Denoising Autoencoder (PyTorch)**
   - Learns to reconstruct complete data from corrupted versions
   - Architecture: Input → 32 → 16 → 32 → Output
   - Uses dropout for regularization

3. **Variational Autoencoder (VAE)**
   - Probabilistic imputation with uncertainty quantification
   - Multiple imputation samples to capture uncertainty
   - Latent dimension: 8

4. **GAIN (Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks)**
   - Generator creates imputations
   - Discriminator tries to identify imputed values
   - Uses hint vector mechanism

5. **Synthetic MNAR Validation**
   - Creates synthetic missing patterns mimicking personality-based missingness
   - Tests how well each method handles MNAR (Missing Not At Random)

## Expected Runtime
- Each method involves 5-fold cross-validation
- Deep learning methods train for 100 epochs
- Total estimated time: 30-60 minutes depending on hardware

## What We're Looking For
1. Can personality-aware imputation outperform standard methods?
2. Do deep learning methods capture the MNAR pattern better?
3. Which method best preserves the personality-encoding nature of missingness?
4. Can any method help us break the 0.975708 accuracy ceiling?

## Current Status
The script is running on GPU (if available) to accelerate deep learning methods.
