# Advanced Imputation Methods Testing - TODO

## Date: 2025-07-05 09:50
## Project: Kaggle Playground Series S5E7 - Personality Classification

## Background
Previous analysis revealed that missing values are NOT random - they encode personality information:
- `Drained_after_socializing` missing → -0.198 correlation with Extroversion
- `Stage_fear` missing → -0.102 correlation with Extroversion
- Introverts are significantly more likely to have missing values

## Objective
Test advanced imputation methods to potentially leverage the personality-encoding nature of missing values and break through the 0.975708 accuracy ceiling.

## Tasks

### 1. Advanced ML Methods
- [ ] Implement MissForest-style Random Forest imputation
- [ ] Test with personality-aware imputation (use target in imputation for training)
- [ ] Compare performance with baseline methods
- [ ] Analyze which features benefit most from advanced imputation

### 2. Deep Learning Methods (PyTorch)
- [ ] Implement Denoising Autoencoder for imputation
- [ ] Create personality-aware loss function that considers missing patterns
- [ ] Test different architectures (shallow vs deep)
- [ ] Implement dropout and regularization

### 3. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- [ ] Implement VAE for probabilistic imputation
- [ ] Generate multiple imputations to capture uncertainty
- [ ] Test if uncertainty correlates with ambivert cases
- [ ] Compare single vs multiple imputation performance

### 4. GAIN (Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks)
- [ ] Implement GAIN architecture in PyTorch
- [ ] Use hint vector to guide imputation
- [ ] Test if GAN can learn personality-specific missing patterns
- [ ] Compare with other deep learning methods

### 5. Synthetic Missing Pattern Generation
- [ ] Generate MNAR patterns that mimic personality-based missingness
- [ ] Create synthetic test sets with known ground truth
- [ ] Validate all methods on synthetic data
- [ ] Analyze which methods best capture MNAR patterns

### 6. Ensemble and Analysis
- [ ] Create ensemble of best imputation methods
- [ ] Analyze if different methods work better for different personality types
- [ ] Test if imputation quality correlates with ambivert detection
- [ ] Generate final report with recommendations

## Evaluation Metrics
- Cross-validation accuracy (CV=5) on personality classification
- Imputation quality metrics (RMSE, MAE) on synthetic data
- Analysis of imputed value distributions by personality type
- Correlation preservation between features
- Uncertainty quantification for probabilistic methods

## Special Considerations
- Since missing values encode personality, we'll test "personality-aware" imputation
- Focus on psychological features (Drained_after_socializing, Stage_fear)
- Test if advanced methods can learn the MNAR mechanism
- Consider computational efficiency for Kaggle submission

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify if advanced imputation can leverage personality-encoding missingness
- Determine if deep learning methods outperform traditional approaches
- Find optimal imputation strategy for breaking the 0.975708 ceiling
- Generate insights about the relationship between missingness and ambiverts

## Timeline
- Implementation: ~3 hours
- Testing & Evaluation: ~2 hours
- Report Generation: ~1 hour
