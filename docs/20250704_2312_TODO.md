# TODO: Breaking the 0.976518 Barrier - Action Plan
**Date**: 2025-01-04 23:12  
**Goal**: Achieve score > 0.975708, targeting 0.976518  
**Resources**: 200GB RAM, 2x4090 GPU server

## Tasks

### 1. 🏃 Deep Optuna Optimization (GPU Server)
- [x] Create script for 1000+ trials optimization
- [ ] Test XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost with extensive hyperparameter search
- [ ] Use GPU acceleration where possible
- [ ] Expected runtime: 2-4 hours
**Status**: Script created, running on GPU server

### 2. ✅ ID Pattern Analysis
- [x] Analyze test/train ID structure
- [x] Check for hash patterns, modulo operations
- [x] Look for hidden information in ID encoding
- [x] Test deterministic rules based on ID
**Result**: IDs are sequential, no hidden patterns found

### 3. 🏃 Neural Network Deep Learning
- [x] Implement transformer-based model
- [x] Test attention mechanisms for feature interactions
- [ ] Train autoencoder for anomaly detection
- [x] Use GPU for fast training
**Status**: Script created with 3 architectures, running on GPU

### 4. ✅ Precision Threshold Optimization
- [ ] Calculate optimal threshold per feature value
- [ ] Create lookup table for all feature combinations
- [ ] Implement isotonic regression calibration
- [ ] Test on validation set

### 5. ✅ Pseudo-labeling Strategy
- [ ] Identify high-confidence predictions on test set
- [ ] Iteratively retrain with pseudo-labels
- [ ] Implement confidence-based weighting
- [ ] Monitor for overfitting

### 6. ✅ Error Analysis of 0.975708 Plateau
- [ ] Analyze common misclassifications
- [ ] Find patterns in edge cases
- [ ] Focus on improving specific error types
- [ ] Create targeted rules

### 7. ✅ AutoGluon Extended Training
- [ ] Run AutoGluon with time_limit=7200 (2 hours)
- [ ] Enable all model types including NN
- [ ] Use bagging and stacking
- [ ] Leverage GPU acceleration

### 8. ✅ Ensemble Diversity Analysis
- [ ] Create diverse models with different random seeds
- [ ] Use different subsets of features
- [ ] Implement voting and stacking strategies
- [ ] Optimize ensemble weights

## Execution Order
1. Start with GPU-intensive tasks (1, 3, 7)
2. Run CPU tasks in parallel (2, 4, 6)
3. Combine insights for final submissions (5, 8)

## Success Metrics
- CV score > 0.975708
- At least one submission targeting 0.976518
- Clear understanding of why someone achieved 0.976518
