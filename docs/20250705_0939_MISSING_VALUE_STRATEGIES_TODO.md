# Missing Value Handling Strategies - TODO

## Date: 2025-07-05 09:39
## Project: Kaggle Playground Series S5E7 - Personality Classification

## Objective
Implement and test various missing value handling strategies to potentially improve model performance beyond the current 0.975708 accuracy ceiling.

## Tasks

### 1. Missing Indicators Strategy
- [ ] Implement missing indicator features using sklearn's MissingIndicator
- [ ] Create pipeline combining imputation with missing indicators
- [ ] Test with RandomForest, XGBoost, and LightGBM
- [ ] Evaluate CV=5 performance
- [ ] Compare with baseline (no missing indicators)

### 2. Pattern Submodels Strategy
- [ ] Identify unique missing patterns in the dataset
- [ ] Create separate models for each missing pattern
- [ ] Implement prediction aggregation strategy
- [ ] Test on validation set with CV=5
- [ ] Analyze which patterns contribute most to performance

### 3. Missing Pattern Visualization & Analysis
- [ ] Create missing value matrix visualization
- [ ] Generate correlation heatmap for missing patterns
- [ ] Analyze correlation between missingness and target variable
- [ ] Perform chi-square tests for each feature's missingness
- [ ] Document significant patterns

### 4. Advanced Deep Learning Approach (Optional)
- [ ] Design missingness-aware autoencoder architecture
- [ ] Implement if time permits and initial strategies show promise
- [ ] Compare with simpler approaches

### 5. Synthetic Missing Pattern Generation
- [ ] Implement MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) generator
- [ ] Implement MAR (Missing At Random) generator
- [ ] Implement MNAR (Missing Not At Random) generator
- [ ] Test model robustness on synthetic patterns
- [ ] Analyze which mechanism best matches our data

## Evaluation Metrics
- Cross-validation accuracy (CV=5)
- Improvement over baseline (current 0.975708)
- Pattern-specific performance
- Computational efficiency
- Model interpretability

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify if missing patterns encode personality information
- Determine best strategy for handling missing values
- Potentially break through the 0.975708 accuracy ceiling
- Generate insights for future improvements

## Timeline
- Implementation: ~2 hours
- Testing & Evaluation: ~1 hour
- Report Generation: ~30 minutes
